    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>In homework 3 I figured out how to display different map projections by using the coordinate reference system (CRS) on QGIS.
        There were many different options available, some projecting globe like patterns and others stretching the base map either
        horizontally or vertically. The indicatrix matrix also displayed circles that showed the extent to which the map was distorted.
        For each projection, I created a new project and then applied the CRS and indicatrix matrix to see how each map differed. 
        I also changed the symbology of the maps to be purple and orange as this is a good color contrast and allows for differences to be seen.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 projection shows the world map regularly at the intersection of the prime meridian and the equator.
        However, it is distorted to make the world at higher latitudes look much bigger than it actually is.
        Antartica is actually not this big, and not that wide but WGS84 stretches out the globe near its extremeties to 
        make it more distorted. The circles from the indicatrix also get larger as you go to the edges of the map.

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The aitoff projection displays the earth in a globe like fashion. 
        It appears the western and eastern part of the maps, as well as southern and northern parts experience more distortion.
        Latitudes and Longitudes near the equator and priime meridian remaine relatively unchanged.
        The circles from the indicatrix also appear curved towards the edges of the map.

    <h2>3857 Projection</h2>
    <h3>In the 3857 map, there is extreme distortion at high latitudes.
        In this projection Greenland is almost as big as Africa, when in reality Africa is over ten times bigger!
        There is very little distortion in the middle of the map. Places like Antartica, Russia, and Canada also appear massive.

    <h2>53018 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The 53018 projection is somewhat similar to the Aitoff one, but as longitude increases in this version thr distortion becomes much more apparent. 
        In this projection Antartica is much larger than the Aitoff one, and the map isn't as scrunched up at the poles.
        There is also some distortion where the prime meridian and equator meet.

    <h2>54034 Projection</h2>
    <h3> The 54034 projection is much different than the ones already looked at.
        In this projection there is extreme compressing of the map at maximum latitudes. 
        Antartica is almost invisible on the map and Russia and Canada look much smaller than they do on a normal map. 
        In addition to this Africa is much bigger and is the largest landmark on the map.
        There also appears to be no distortion as longitude changes on this map.

    <h2>54027 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The 54027 projection is also a idiosyncratic projection compared to the previous ones looked at. 
        It appears as if someone took an ariel pricture of the Earth and compressed it to surround the North Pole.
        Antartica is massive in this projection, and almost surrounds the entire globe. 
        There is extreme expansion distortion at southern latitudes and compression distortion at nothern ones.

    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
