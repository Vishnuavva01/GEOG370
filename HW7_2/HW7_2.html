    The topic I decided to choose was related to COVID-19 and the total amount of deaths each state has experienced from the illness.
    COVID-19 has been a big issue in America the past few years with much debate towards the severity and urgency of the situation.
    Different states implemented different policies, some being more strict than others so I wanted to see how this possibly affected death tolls. 
    The data was obtained from the CovidActNow website and provided information going from state level to county level.
    I decided to look at state data, and the amount of deaths that occured in each one because I was curious to see which ones had the most deaths. 
    On the map itself, it appears that the most amount of deaths occured in states such as Florida, Texas, California, and New York.
    THis makes sense as these states have the highest population of people. 
    States with lower populations such as Montana and North Dakota had little deaths.
    North Carolina appeared to be right in the middle of deaths.
