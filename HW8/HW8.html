    <h3> 
        The real world problem I decided to look at was the amount of police incidents near 
        my apartment in chapel hill. To create this map, I found a vector shapefile of points where 
        there were police incidents in Chapel Hill since 2010. I then created a new point layer 
        where I designated a point as my apartment. After, I created a buffer around my apartment of 1.5 miles
        to see how many incidents have occured. I then performed and intersection method to find the exact number of 
        incidents in my proximity. This number came out to be 50,118. This problem was interesting to me because I wanted to 
        see how dangerous the sorrounding area actually is to me and my friends. A high number of 50k causes 
        a lot to be concerned about. It may be interesting for the future. to see how many of these incidents turned into arrests or how many 
        were violent confrontations.
