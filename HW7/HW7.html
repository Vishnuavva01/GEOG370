    <h3> The ratio I decided to use for this project was the ratio between county population and the entire population of Oregon.
        I thought that this provided a good indication for the percentage of people that lived in each county in the state and could be classified further more easily.
        It also is good variation as opposed to total people in each county as it made each county bound to one standard number.
        As far as the classifications, I chose equal interval, quantile, and standard deviation. 
        Equal interval divides the range of attribute values into equally sized classes, which are determined by the user. 
        In this case I chose seven classes. 
        Some pros of using equal interval is that it is efficient for continous data sets, and also creates a legend that is easily read by any audience. 
        Cons are that most of the data set will usually end up taking one or two classes leaving it hard to see varation in the data.
        The next classification used was
