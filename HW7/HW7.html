    <h3> The chloropeth I decided to make was on the median income by county in Oregon.
         The median incomes ranged from 42000 to 92000. 
         As far as the distribution goes most of the counties have a median income from 55000 to 64000. 
         One of the northwestern counties is in the biggest median income range and there a couple counties in the lowest range in the southeastern portion. 
         Overall, there is a good mix of distribution around the state and income seems to be somewhat based on location.
